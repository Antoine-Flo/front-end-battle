# FrontEndBattle

## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Front-end Battle is a small app similar to [CSS battle](https://cssbattle.dev/). You can create and resolve front-end challenges.

There is still a lot to do, for now you can singup with Google or GitHub and try the embedded text-editor, soon I will add some challenges.


[Test the app](https://front-end-battle.vercel.app/)

## How it's made

### Authentication
The authentication is handled by Firebase, it's really fast to configure and really secure.

### Database
I've made the back-end with NestJs, I still have to configure the communication with the database.
