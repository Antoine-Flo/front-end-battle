# FrontEndBattle

## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Front-end Battle is a small app similar to [CSS battle](https://cssbattle.dev/). You can create and resolve front-end challenges.

There is still a lot to do, for now you can singup with Google or GitHub and try the embedded text-editor, soon I will add some challenges.


[Test the app](https://front-end-battle.vercel.app/)

## How it's made

### Technos :
Angular - NestJs - MongoDB - Nginx - PM2 -Ubuntu

### Authentication
The authentication is handled by Firebase, it's really fast to configure and really secure.

### Back-end
I've made the back-end with NestJs, it's a NodeJs framework really close to Angular, I installed PM2 on the ubuntu server to execute NodeJs.

### Database
All the datas are hosted on MongoDb Atlas, it's easy to deploy and secure.

### Server
The back-end is hosted on DigitalOcean, I really like the developper experience on this web-site, I used Nginx as proxy to configure the SSL certificate and the redirections (from http to https).
